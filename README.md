# Cambridge Audio Air CLI

## About

These two utilities allow you to reveal / set the radio preset settings on a
Cambridge Audio Air v2 network streamer/speaker.  It might be compatible with
Cambridge Audio Minx devices, though not tested as I don't own a Minx.

## Why?

My Cambridge Audio Air v2 stopped playing Classic FM.  Wireshark came to the
rescue, I noticed the device tries to play the Classic FM radio via an https
stream and the TLSv1.2 negotiation fails.  Then I started inspecting the binary
control protocol between the Android Air app and the device.  As a result, here
are two prototyped python cli programs - `camair-get.py` and `camair-set.py`.
I was able to overwrite the preset's stream url to use a plain http stream for
Classic FM.  ðŸ™‚

## Usage

- `camair-get.py` dumps the preset configuration as a JSON document.
- `camair-set.py` changes any preset's `stream url`, `name` or the `logo url`
